# üîç GUARDIO ASSIGNMENT VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**Purpose**: Exhaustive audit to identify ANY gaps, inconsistencies, or missed requirements before final presentation.

---

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION METHODOLOGY

### 1. SCHEMA COMPLIANCE AUDIT
- [x] Compare EVERY column in mock database vs. assignment schema specification
- [x] Verify data types match exactly (STRING vs VARCHAR, TIMESTAMP vs DATE, etc.)
- [x] Check that referrer_url format matches: `https://guard.io/?utm_source={source}&utm_campaign={campaign_id}&utm_adset={adset_id}&utm_ad={ad_id}`
- [x] Validate organic format is exactly: `https://guard.io/`
- [x] Confirm no extra columns exist that weren't specified

### 2. ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS FORENSICS
- [x] Read every "‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up!" and warning in the assignment
- [x] Check every bulleted requirement in each task
- [x] Verify every guideline is implemented, not just mentioned
- [x] Cross-reference website features against assignment asks
- [x] Look for any requirements hidden in problem descriptions

### 3. SQL SOLUTION VALIDATION
- [x] Does Task 1 output have EXACTLY the 18 columns specified?
- [x] Are column names character-for-character identical to assignment?
- [x] Does the 14-day attribution window logic match the specification?
- [x] Is the organic vs marketing logic exactly as described?
- [x] Are campaign name changes handled as the assignment warned?

### 4. WEBSITE COMPLETENESS CHECK
- [x] Does the website show the ACTUAL deliverable tables requested?
- [x] Are the mock database tables browsable and realistic?
- [x] Do the interactive demos actually demonstrate the SQL queries?
- [x] Can users download the exact output formats requested?
- [x] Is every task requirement visually demonstrated?

### 5. EDGE CASE TESTING
- [x] What happens with users who have no marketing touchpoints?
- [x] What happens with users who have only organic sessions?
- [x] How are NULL values handled in attribution results?
- [x] Are campaign name changes actually visible in the data?
- [x] Does the CPA calculation handle zero activations correctly?

### 6. BUSINESS LOGIC VERIFICATION
- [x] Is the attribution window "14 days prior to and including activation session"?
- [x] Are sessions "after activation" properly excluded?
- [x] Is the "paying customer" definition correctly interpreted as `is_activated = 1`?
- [x] Are the marketing parameters parsed from referrer_url, not stored separately?

### 7. PRESENTATION READINESS
- [x] Will a technical interviewer find any obvious flaws?
- [x] Are there any inconsistencies between SQL code and website demo?
- [x] Is the mock data realistic enough to be convincing?
- [x] Would Guardio's marketing team understand the business value?

## üéØ SPECIFIC VALIDATION TASKS

1. [x] Open the assignment file and read EVERY requirement line-by-line
2. [x] Visit the live website and click through EVERY feature
3. [x] Compare the complete attribution results table column-by-column with assignment specs
4. [x] Verify the CPA dashboard preparation table has atomic granularity as required
5. [x] Check that performance optimization addresses the specific bottlenecks mentioned
6. [x] Validate that campaign name changes are actually demonstrated in the data
7. [x] Test edge cases in the interactive demos
8. [x] Review SQL solutions for any logical errors or missed requirements

## üö® RED FLAGS TO FIND

- [ ] Column names that don't match assignment exactly
- [ ] Mock data that's too clean/unrealistic
- [ ] Missing edge case handling
- [ ] Features that look impressive but don't address requirements
- [ ] Logical errors in SQL attribution rules
- [ ] Inconsistencies between different parts of the implementation

---

## üéØ CHALLENGE GOAL
Find every possible flaw, gap, or missed requirement so the presentation is bulletproof. Be ruthlessly critical - assume the interviewer will be looking for any excuse to find problems.

## üìã VALIDATION RESULTS

### ISSUES FOUND:

1. **‚ùå DATA TYPE MISMATCH** - Campaign spend dates stored as strings instead of Date objects
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
   - **Fix**: Changed date generation to use proper Date objects with start-of-day precision

2. **‚ùå CAMPAIGN NAME CHANGES NOT REALISTIC** - Mock data had static names instead of changing over time  
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
   - **Fix**: Implemented time-based name variations (20% chance every 7 days)

3. **‚ùå POTENTIAL ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE:**
   - CPA table generation uses string dates while main mock uses Date objects (inconsistency)
   - Need to verify all 18 attribution columns display correctly on website
   - Need to test edge cases (organic-only users, NULL handling)
   - Need to verify 14-day window logic is correctly implemented

### FIXES COMPLETED:
- [x] ‚úÖ Fixed date inconsistency between mock data generators
- [x] ‚úÖ Verified website shows complete attribution table correctly (all 18 columns)
- [x] ‚úÖ Tested edge cases - organic users, NULL values, zero activations all handled
- [x] ‚úÖ Validated 14-day attribution window logic is correctly implemented
- [x] ‚úÖ Added CPA calculation safety check for zero activations

### FINAL STATUS:
- [x] ‚úÖ READY FOR PRESENTATION  
- [ ] ‚ùå REQUIRES FIXES

**ASSIGNMENT STATUS: BULLETPROOF ‚úÖ**
